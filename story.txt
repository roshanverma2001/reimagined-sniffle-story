January 20th, 2021: A cloudy day that will live in infamy. The world watched as the sun set behind the capitol, holding thier breath to keep from breathing the smell of 
fireworks. Every TV channel showed the same thing, and everyone listened, as one man uttered 
the words to officially become the President of the United states. Suddenly, instead of waving
to the crowd, rap music from the Kanye song "Everything I am" started playing: "My fifteen
seconds up, but I got more to say. That's enough Mr. West, please no more today." Yet
unfortunately, for the next 4 years, there was more than enough Mr. West

The voters were surprised by the reference to Kanye West, but did not think much of it. 
However, the public was quite shocked by how the newly elected president only spoke using Kayne West
lyrics. When asked to comment on his Kanye addiction, the president simply stated,
"I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm going back to school"

A year later, the president establishes an elementary school, which he claimed "for adults only".
He, together with many others who want to see what will happen, enter that school.
The president hires the best elementary school teachers all around the U.S.
In the first day of school, every media attend the ceremony.

The first thing the students need to do is rank their Kanye consumption, from "little to no Kanye" to being Kanye himself
